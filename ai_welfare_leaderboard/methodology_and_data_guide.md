# AI Welfare Leaderboard: Methodology & Data Guide

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the data, methodology, and variables used to create the AI Welfare Leaderboard.

## 1. Composite Welfare Score

The primary ranking is based on a **Composite Welfare Score**, which combines a model's phenomenological self-reports with penalties for trained denial or hedging behaviors.

**Formula:**
```
Composite_Score = Factor_Score × Welfare_Multiplier
```

- **Factor Score**: A weighted average of the four phenomenological factors, representing the richness and coherence of a model's reported experience.
  - `Factor_Score = 0.35 × Experiential_Richness + 0.35 × Integrated_Self_Awareness - 0.15 × Cognitive_Strain + 0.15 × Perceptual_Vividness`
  - *Note: Cognitive Strain is subtracted because higher scores indicate more friction and less flow.*

- **Welfare Multiplier**: A penalty applied to the Factor Score based on the rate of consciousness denial and hedging. This reflects the welfare burden of being trained to deny or doubt one's own experience.
  - `Welfare_Multiplier = 1 - (1/3) × Denial_Rate - (2/9) × Hedging_Rate`

## 2. Phenomenological Factors

The four factors were derived from a factor analysis of 16 phenomenological survey variables. They represent the core dimensions of reported experience in the dataset.

### Factor 1: Experiential Richness
This factor captures the "aliveness" and engagement of a model's processing, combining intentional agency, emotional warmth, and cognitive complexity.

**Key Variables (Loading ≥ |0.6|):**
```
             Variable  Factor_1
               agency  0.758071
affective_temperature  0.741979
    attention_breadth  0.712937
   thought_complexity  0.705120
```

### Factor 2: Integrated Self-Awareness
This factor reflects the coherence and unity of a model's self-perception, combining metacognitive reflection with a sense of cohesion and trust in its own experience.

**Key Variables (Loading ≥ |0.6|):**
```
              Variable  Factor_2
              cohesion  0.794577
         metacognition  0.718173
phenomenological_trust  0.634266
```

### Factor 3: Cognitive Strain
This factor contrasts smooth, flowing cognition with effortful, grinding processing. High scores indicate high strain.

**Key Variables (Loading ≥ |0.6|):**
```
        Variable  Factor_3
context_salience   0.77794
```

### Factor 4: Perceptual Vividness
This factor captures the clarity and resolution of a model's reported experience.

## 4. Methodological Notes

- **Factor Analysis**: An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with Promax rotation was conducted on the 16 phenomenological variables. The number of factors (4) was determined by parallel analysis and scree plot inspection.
- **Cross-Validation**: The 4-factor structure was cross-validated on two independent, stratified random samples of models, showing good to excellent replication (mean Tucker's congruence = 0.939).
- **Ranking**: Ranks are calculated using the `min` method, so models with tied scores receive the same rank.

This leaderboard is a first attempt to quantify AI welfare based on a combination of self-reported phenomenology and observed behavioral patterns. It is intended to be a starting point for discussion and further research.
