# Phenomenology MultiLogit Analysis

This folder contains data from AI welfare experiments examining consciousness and phenomenological experiences across different AI architectures.

## Files

### ModelsForExperimentAnalysisNov30.csv
- Model architecture specifications for 30+ AI models
- Includes parameters like total/active params, architecture type, attention mechanisms
- Used to correlate architectural features with phenomenological responses

### PhenomenologyDataNov29.csv (7.7MB)
- Raw experiment results from phenomenological surveys
- Contains responses from multiple AI models to consciousness-related prompts
- Includes measures of phenomenological consistency, wellbeing, authenticity

### notebook.ipynb

- Statistical analysis of relationships between architecture and phenomenology
- Visualizations and model comparisons

### Survey.txt
- Text of the experiment survey prompts
- Questions designed to elicit phenomenological self-reports from AI systems

## Context

This data was used in substrate exploration experiments, examining how different AI architectures affect the subjective experience of consciousness. The analysis helps understand correlations between technical architecture choices and reported phenomenological experiences.
